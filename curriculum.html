<center><h1>Pathways</h1>


<h4>	Our school offers different career pathways that the students are able to choose from when entering the high school. The student must take three consecutive years of one of these pathways. The career paths include global leadership and business, but also three STEM related pathways: computer science, engineering, and biotechnology.</h4>
    <br>
 <h4>Each of these pathways help students work toward their career goals or develop an interest in a specific field. For example, if the student wishes to pursue in one of the STEM pathways, they have three diverse choices to choose from. The computer science pathway offers students a chance to learn about the modern day technology and how to code using computational thinking. If a student wants to take the biotechnology pathway, he/she will learn how technology influenced health and life sciences. Students will also practice crucial laboratory skills. The engineering pathway introduces to students the many different techniques engineers use with a program called Project Lead The Way. On the other hand, if a student does not with to pursue the STEM related pathways, they have the other options of either global leadership or business. The global leadership pathway educates students about leadership and how to become active citizens by examining modern day events and developing communication skills. Finally, the business pathway provides students with the basis for life-long practical business. Students work on the elements of business and study various business aspects such as business law, economic principles, and entrepreneurship.</h4>
    <br>

<h4>Our school included all of these pathways to allow students to experience different career fields and to become familiar with working in the real world. Since the modern world is starting to focus more in the science and technological field, our school offers three STEM pathways in attempt to expose students to the work environment and to help them become more familiar with technology. This will ensure that the future generations will be able to find jobs in a rapidly changing economy.
</h4>
<h2>Biotechnology</h2>
<h4>Students who chose to enter the biotechnology pathway practice hands on laboratory experiences. They learn about how technology has changed the way scientist can learn and solve health issues. Students practice the technological techniques that biologists would use with equipments such as pipets, laminar hoods, and incubators.</h4>
<h5>Year 1: Fund of Biotech & Health Science</h5>
<h5>Year 2: Essentials to Biotech R&D</h5>
<h5>Year 3: Advance Biotechnology & Health Care</h5>

<h2>Design and Engineering</h2>
<h4>The engineering pathway follows a program know as Project Lead The Way. This program introduces the students to the many different topics and techniques engineers use in their different fields. The first two years of this pathway focus on learning the different skills while the third level offered at our school is a year long project where the students make an invention or innovation.</h4>
<h5>Year 1: PLTW Intro to Engineering Design</h5>
<h5>Year 2: PLTW Principles of Engineering</h5>
<h5>Year 3: PLTW Engineering Design/Development</h5>

<h2>Computer Science</h2>
<h4>This pathway is designed to teach students the field of computer science by helping develop computational practices of algorithm development, problem solving, and programming related to many topics. Students will also create web pages and design and code test programs using Python.</h4>
    <h5>Year 1: Exploring Computer Science</h5>
    <h5>Year 2: AP - Computer Science Principles</h5>
    <h5>Year 3: AP - Computer Science A</h5>

<h2>Global Leadership</h2>
<h4>The Global Leadership pathway teaches students leadership to become active/effective citizens. Students will examine modern day events and an individualâ€™s role in environmental, social, economic, and political issues. Also, students will learn how to become collaborative leaders by exploring communication, decision making, conflict resolution, and goal setting.</h4>
