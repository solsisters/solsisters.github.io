<h1>Meetings</h1>
<h2>In-School</h2>
    <h4>Meetings are held twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays during activity period. Activity period is a 30 minute long period of time that occurs during the middle of every schools day. During activity period, students have the opportunity to go in for extra help in their classes, attend club meetings, and make up work if they have missed class.</h4>
<h2>After-School</h2>
        <h4>In addition to being held during activity period twice a week, students can also meet after school on most days anytime from 2:25 p.m. to  4:00 p.m. TSA members are required to attend at least one of these meetings each week. During these meetings, students either continue working on their individual events or regroup with their teams and go over what each member did that week or what they need to do next. </h4>
        
<h1>Accountability</h1>
        <h2>Sign-In Sheet</h2>
        <h4>As for keeping track of attendance, there is a sign in sheet passed around at the beginning of every meeting, and students must sign their names on the sheet, which is what is used to evaluate how many meetings each students has attended.</h4>

        <h2>Check-In Forms</h2>
        <h4>On top of using a sign in sheet to ensure that each student is attending meetings, check-in forms are sent out at the beginning of each month, and students can either fill them out online or on paper. On these forms, TSA members must write what events they are participating in, what progress they have made, and what materials they will need. Only one person from each team is required to complete the check-in forms. After they are completed, students check in face-to-face with the TSA officer who is assigned to their event. During this check-in, officers assess the progress each student or team has made in their event and make sure that they know what the deadlines and expectations are. </h4>
