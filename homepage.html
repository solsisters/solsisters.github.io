    <center><h3>☀Tori☀</h3></center>
    <center><h4>Tori Jones has lived a life of fame ever since she was young. She became a model at the age of 4, and continues her career to this day. Not only is Tori a model, but she has stunning musical talent too. She often accompanies Violet on voice, and plays the guitar, piano, and ukulele.</h4></center>
    <br>
    <center><h3>☀Grace☀</h3></center>
    <center><h4>Grace Smith is the songwriter for the Sol Sisters. Ever since she was young, Grace was known to be very musically talented. Her ability to come up with song lyrics amazed her friends and family, and she hoped to continue her career as a songwriter. After hearing her twin sister, Hope, play her guitar, she convinced her sister to create the Sol Sisters. “I knew we could do it,” she says. “If we dream it, we can achieve it.” As well as writing the songs, Grace plays the piano during the concerts.</h4></center>
    <br>
    <center><h3>☀Violet☀</h3></center>
    <center><h4>Violet Johnson is not only the youngest member of the Sol Sisters but also the most remembered. She is the main singer of the Sol Sisters, and her powerful voice always fascinates the audience. She joined the group only a year ago but has proved to be a wonderful new edition to the band. Violet can also play the guitar, the cello, and the drums.</h4></center>
    <br>
    <center><h3>☀Hope☀</h3></center>
    <center><h4>Comedian, guitarist, and drummer, Hope Smith was one of the first members while creating the Sol Sisters. She discovered her talent for guitar in middle school, and decided to pursue her career with her twin sister, Grace. The Sol Sisters credit her for her passion and drive for achievement which always inspires the other members to work harder.“The only way to achieve anything is with hard work and persistence,” Hope says nearly every day. “Why procrastinate? It’s better to start now.”</h4></center>
